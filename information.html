                        <p class="mb-0" style="padding-bottom: 1rem;">An educated person is our best client. Please do your research before deciding on your teeth whitening <br>treatment. Ask questions if you're not sure which treatment to choose. You do not have to do anything specific <br>other than lightly brush your teeth staying away from the gum line before coming in for your teeth whitening <br>treatment. Please DO NOT floss before your appointment. Having your teeth cleaned and scraped before your <br>teeth whitening treatment may help with the process, but it is not necessary to have your teeth cleaned and <br>scraped at the dentist prior to your whitening treatment.<br></p>
                        <p>We do recommend you have your usual 6 months regular check-ups at the dentist. There are many causes for <br>tooth staining. The most common include genetics, aging, consumption of staining substances (smoking, coffee,<br>tea, and colas), tetracycline (antibiotic) staining, excessive fluoride, and old fillings. Whitening toothpaste can <br>remove stains that are on the outside of the teeth. Dentists call this extrinsic staining. However, teeth whitening<br>toothpaste and professional dental cleanings will not change the color or intrinsic staining of the teeth. That is <br>why teeth whitening is also sometimes called tooth bleaching is so popular.<br></p>

                        <p class="mb-0">Cosmetic teeth whitening is considered one of the safest and anti-aging procedures available in dentistry. The <br>procedure consists of three to four 15-20 minute sessions. A fresh layer of teeth whitening gel is applied after <br>each session as the old gel is removed from your teeth. Teeth Whitening works by exfoliating stains from inside <br>your teeth to bring them back to their natural color. We will measure your initial shade, and the final shade to<br>see how many shades lighter you got. But there is no way to predict how many shades lighter your teeth will <br>get beforehand. The whitening process removes stains that we all accumulate over the years from coffee, tea, <br>juice, soda, fruits, and berries, sauces, salads, etc…The final shade is your natural tooth color, which is unique <br>for everyone.<br></p>

Eating fruits and vegetables, drinking red wine, coffees, dark sodas, tea<br>and smoking will cause your teeth to stain your teeth more quickly than going without these foods.<br>But it isn’t all bad news; it is unlikely that your teeth will stain back to the point where they were before <br>your treatment. And, to help counteract the fact that your teeth will stain again, we recommend having <br>your teeth whitened every 3 to 6 months so you can keep your pearly whites. In the meantime, try <br>drinking those staining liquids through a straw and by rinsing your mouth with water after every meal <br>will help keep those pesky stains away.<br></p>

                        <p class="mb-0">By now, you probably know that certain lifestyle choices lead to your teeth staining. Drinking coffee and <br>tea, poor oral hygiene, dark sodas and smoking are the top lifestyle choices that can lead to teeth <br>discoloration. But, if these are not things you have issues with and are still struggling with yellow teeth, <br>chances are, the issue is a little deeper than that. Generally, people can have different shades of teeth. The <br>hue is mainly determined by the dentin (the second layer of hard tissue and typically softer than the <br>enamel); enamel is in fact translucent, hence the underlying dentin, which is yellow, reflects so the color <br>seen is usually light yellow. Discolored dentin could be caused by multiple factors, ie: medications and <br>your genetics. Having a thin enamel layer on your teeth will also cause the dentin layer to show through <br>more clearly. Even in the same individual, the different types of teeth can have different shades. For <br>instance, the canine has more bulk of dentin and thus appears more yellowish than the others. Even in a <br>single tooth, the color varies. The part of the tooth closer to the gum appears more yellowish than the part <br>close to the edge. The good news is that there is still a way to whiten your teeth even if your dentin layer <br>is to blame for yellow teeth. Our whitening process whitens all the way down to the dentin layer, by <br>gently lifting the stains one layer at the time. Allowing your teeth to look brighter and whiter!<br></p>

They also happen to be what gives the tea the deep, complex flavor that you know and <br>love. They may taste great, but they're what gives your tea that dark color that clings to your white enamel (the <br>outer layer of your teeth), leaving stains and dulling your smile. When it comes to drinks, it's not just the darker <br>hues you have to look out for. There are some light-colored culprits too. White tea can erode your enamel and <br>white wine is even more acidic than red! Try to limit your intake. When you do have them, swish with water to<br>get off as much residue as you can. Whenever possible, use a straw to limit the liquid's contact with your teeth.<br></p>

Crowns and veneers are made of <br>porcelain, the shade of which cannot be changed. That doesn’t mean that you should not do teeth whitening if <br>you have a crown, veneer, or a filling on a front tooth. Often the color of the restorative work is actually lighter <br>than the rest of the teeth.<br></p>

But, what happens to cause those dull, white spots<br>that stand out on teeth, and are they healthy? Those dull white spots are usually the result of a loss of minerals<br>in the enamel layer of the tooth. But why does it happen? Some surprising causes of those white spots are…<br><br></p>
                        <h5>SMOKING... WHILE PREGNANT</h5>
                        <p>Another example of the negative side effects of smoking, smokers are not just risking their own teeth. Pregnant <br>smokers run the risk of damaging the unborn baby’s teeth. Teeth form early, well before the baby is born. <br>Therefore, save your baby from weak spots and lifelong tooth struggles, and avoid tobacco while pregnant.<br></p>
                        <h5>TOO MUCH FLUORIDE</h5>
                        <p>Normally, we think of fluoride as a good thing for teeth, and it is. But, a condition called fluorosis can happen if <br>you get way too much fluoride. The people most likely to suffer from fluorosis are children; their smaller bodies<br>have lower capacities for fluoride. That’s the reason all toothpaste that contains fluoride advise carefully <br>supervising children while brushing and using a pea-sized amount of cleaner. Of course, fluoride in proper <br>amounts is still good for teeth, especially in childhood when teeth are growing in, so it’s important to check with<br>your dentist if you have concerns about whether you or your child are getting the correct amount of fluoride. <br>CariFree Gels come in fluoride-free and fluoride-containing varieties to help meet your needs.<br></p>

                        <p>A diet short in calcium deprives your body of the building blocks of healthy enamel. In fact, several minerals <br>that are part of a healthy and balanced diet help build up tooth enamel, and not having enough minerals available<br>can mean your teeth pay the price with white, demineralized spots. Interestingly enough, celiac disease, because <br>it causes the intestines to malfunction and not absorb nutrients, can cause a significant amount of demineralized <br>white spots on the teeth.<br></p>
                        <h5>BACTERIA OVERGROWTH</h5>
                        <p>Bacteria love to grow on teeth. Cavity-causing bacteria particularly love to grow in the high acid environment <br>that results from eating. Poor brushing technique of the teeth will let the bacteria continue to flourish. Braces<br>and other glued in dental appliances can make it more difficult to brush well. It’s important to be vigilant about <br>brushing well, particularly when wearing braces, to keep cavity-causing bacteria from stripping minerals away <br>from teeth, causing the white spots that easily progress to cavities.<br></p>
                        <h5>SOME MEDICINES</h5>
                        <p>We count on medicine to make us healthy. Unfortunately, some medicines have been known to cause white <br>spots on tooth enamel. One reason why certain antibiotics are not approved for use in children. Make sure if <br>you are pregnant or nursing to share that information with any doctor prescribing medication for you. Please do <br>not share prescriptions, and use medications exactly as prescribed. If you do end up with white spots after <br>medical treatment, see your dentist for help treating them (and making sure you’ve identified all possible <br>causes).<br></p>
                        <h5>HIGH FEVERS</h5>
                        <p>A high fever in a child can cause the dreaded white spot on the tooth, linked to the loss of minerals on that spot.<br>While it may not be your first thought to keep your child brushing their teeth through about with the flu, it is <br>important to encourage proper hygiene when possible. Even a gentle swipe with the toothbrush and plain water <br>can also help rehydrate a dry mouth and remove some plaque acids. Many of us have white spots or streaks on <br>our teeth, often we may not realize they exist. We’ll inspect your teeth before starting the procedure and point to<br>any white spots we find. They’re often covered up by stains and don’t show up prominently. The white spots <br>may have been caused by previous orthodontic treatment or may be genetic. As we remove the stains from teeth<br>with whitening, white spots will become more prominent. The white spots will also get even brighter because <br>they will whiten as well. Usually, after a few days, the white spots will blend in a bit more. But expect them to <br>possibly stand out more in the beginning.<br></p>

                        <p class="mb-0" style="padding-bottom: 1REM;">Inside every tooth are millions of microscopic "dentinal tubules" that extend from the nerve (pulp) inside the <br>tooth to the outside surface of the tooth. There's the fluid inside these tiny tubes and when this fluid moves <br>inside the tubes, it causes sensitivity. Minerals from saliva normally plug up the open outer ends of the tubes, <br>preventing fluid movement and most of the sensitivity. All bleaching gels tend to dissolve these "plugs" <br>allowing the fluid in the tubes to move and cause some sensitivity. Dental sensitivity is the most common issue <br>surrounding teeth whitening-and it can happen to anyone, with almost any method. But, according to Dr. Rod <br>Kurthy, DDS, a recognized expert in the field of whitening science, "how severe the reaction depends on each <br>individual and three important factors: genetics, bleach stability, and acidic reaction."<br></p>
                        <p class="mb-0" style="padding-bottom: 1REM;">Teeth Sensitivity during and after teeth whitening is an important concern for our clients. However, we want<br>you to be comfortable during and after the procedure. While 90% of our clients complete the entire treatment, it<br>is important to understand that completing the three or four 15-minute sessions of teeth whitening is not for <br>everyone.<br></p>
                        <p class="mb-0" style="padding-bottom: 1REM;">Teeth Sensitivity during and after teeth whitening is an important concern for our clients and our office. We <br>monitor our clients closely and encourage them to let us know when they start feeling sensitive. Zinger <br>Sensitivity is a “zing,” or a “zap” that your teeth may feel during the teeth whitening procedure. One or two <br>zingers are normal but more than that means that it’s time to stop. Our clients generally get good results even if<br>they’ve completed just 2 sessions.<br></p>
                        <p class="mb-0" style="padding-bottom: 1REM;">Sensitivity is the body's natural way of telling you that it’s time to stop. In a recent survey of clients who had <br>teeth whitening in our office; 89% reported little or no sensitivity after teeth whitening, 9% of our clients <br>reported some sensitivity, 2% of our clients reported discomfort for the first 24 hours. Although moderate to <br>severe sensitivity is rare, unfortunately, a small percentage of our clients will experience some discomfort after <br>the whitening. We always try to encourage everyone to stop when their teeth start to feel sensitive, it’s not <br>always easy for the client to stop before sensitivity increases. Taking an anti-inflammatory such as Ibuprofen, <br>Advil, Aleve, etc…relieves the nerves inside teeth that got inflamed during the whitening treatment. Tylenol is <br>not an anti-inflammatory, Tylenol works best when taken in combination with an anti-inflammatory. We <br>recommend taking 400mg (2 pills) every 4 hours if sensitivity persists. Certain toothpaste such as Sensodyne <br>can relieve sensitivity. At home, we recommend applying the toothpaste for sensitivity to your teeth for 5-10 <br>minutes.
